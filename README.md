# tomorrowweather
As a father it is useful to know tomorrow weather in order to chose  what my daughter will wear tomorrow 

Since my computer is always switch ON at 19h30, I have set microsoft task_planner to run the script at 19h30, but you can do the same on a raspberry pi with crontab etc.

You need to set the location where you want tomorrow weather by adding your latitude and longitude as float.
In the email module you need to put an integer as port number.
